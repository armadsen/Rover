This project demonstrates the use of NSOperation for loading image data asynchronously, on-demand in a collection view. A very simple photo cache made thread safe using a serial `DispatchQueue` is also included. This was the demo project for a presentation on Concurrent Programming given at CocoaHeads SLC on November 1, 2016. Slides for the presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/armadsen/CocoaHeads-SLC-Presentations/tree/master/IntroToConcurrentProgramming).

Note that this demo is meant to show how to use NSOperation and `DispatchQueue`. It is not meant as a great example of application architecture, and was written in a hurry.
